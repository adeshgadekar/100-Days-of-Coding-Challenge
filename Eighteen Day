Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns an integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

Note: You are not allowed to use inbuilt function.

 

Example 1:

Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = Fr
Output: -1
Explanation: Fr is not present in the
string GeeksForGeeks as substring.
 

Example 2:

Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = For
Output: 5
Explanation: For is present as substring
in GeeksForGeeks from index 5 (0 based
indexing).
